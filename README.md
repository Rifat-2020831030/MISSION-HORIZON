# MISSION HORIZON : A space shooter single player game

A lone astronomer drifts in the endless void, stranded after a catastrophic system failure. His last hope? The Patrot-X Spaceship—a battered but reliable vessel with just enough fuel to reach the nearest space station, Nexus Prime.

But the journey won’t be easy.

☄️ Cosmic Storms rage through the sector, distorting sensors and threatening to tear the ship apart. 👾 Alien Shadows lurk in the asteroid belts, their glowing eyes tracking your every move. And worst of all… the Patrot’s core is unstable. One wrong move, and it’s game over.

The controls are yours now, Captain.

Will you navigate the chaos, outsmart the horrors of deep space, and make it to safety? Or will you become just another ghost in the stellar graveyard?

⚡ Engage thrusters.
🎯 Plot your course.
💀 Survive.
